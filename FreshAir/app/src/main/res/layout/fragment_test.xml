        android:text="Birmingham is the next city in the UK to launch a Clean Air Zone after one started in Bath on March 15. But what exactly will it mean for the city and what benefits is it expected to bring?\n\nBath has a Class C Clean Air Zone, whereas the one in Birmingham is a Class D and comes into effect on June 1, 2021.\n\nClass D zones affect buses, coaches, taxis, private hire vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, vans, minibuses, cars and - potentially - motorcycles if the local authority decides to include those too.\n\nBirmingham City Council says that motorbikes and scooters won't face any charges and can freely go in and out of the CAZ. But all other types of vehicles could be charged if they don't comply with emissions standards and are not eligible for a temporary exemption.\n\nThe city council says that around 25 per cent of the vehicles on Birmingham's roads will have to pay a daily charge for coming into the city centre.\n\nThe area covered by the CAZ is within the A4540 Middleway Ring Road, but not the ring road itself.\n\nThere have been objections to the scheme - with fears it could turn the city into a ghost town - and unions have called for it to be delayed for a year until the music and theatre scene has had chance to recover from a year-long shutdown in the pandemic.\n\nBut Birmingham's director of public health says the CAZ is essential for the city.\n\nHere's nine ways the Clean Air Zone could make life better for Birmingham. Do you agree?\n\n1. Improved health\n\nIn a feasibility study, Birmingham City Council said: \'The main driver for tackling pollution is the benefit to public health.\n\n\'It is also a social justice issue, with more vulnerable people disproportionately affected, particularly given the high number of schools, hospitals and care homes affected by poor air quality.\'\n\nIt has been estimated that cutting emissions will, by 2026, reduce the number of asthmatic children showing bronchitis symptoms each year by 873 in Birmingham and by 1,946 across the wider West Midlands conurbation.\n\nIn 2011, there were 1,896 hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in the West Midlands that were attributable to nitrogen dioxide air pollution, including 774 in Birmingham. By 2026, that should drop by 27 per cent if emissions are cut as expected.\n\nIt is estimated that in 2011 there were 1,359 deaths attributable to particulate air pollution in the West Midlands, including 486 in Birmingham. By 2026, this is expected to decrease to 1,188 in the region and 426 in Birmingham.\n\nIn 2017, it was estimated that air pollution from particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide cost the NHS as much as £157 million that year. Over the years from 2017 to 2025, the cost is estimated as up to £5.56 billion.\n\nParticulate matter means microscopic bits of dust, ash, soot, smoke, aerosols, fumes, mists and vapours floating in the air, with one of the main sources being diesel engines, tyres and brakes.\n\nBreathing in these particles has been linked to asthma, respiratory disease, coronary heart disease, strokes, and lung cancer, with emerging evidence showing impacts on diabetes and low birth weight. These particles are said to reduce average life expectancy in the UK by around six months per person.\n\nWhen nitrogen dioxide is inhaled, it can cause tightening of the airways in the lungs, leading to wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath, as well as inflammation and reduced immune response. NO2 has been associated with causing asthma and lung cancer, with emerging evidence showing impacts on type 2 diabetes, low birth weight and dementia. NO2 can also exacerbate existing conditions, especially asthma.\n\n2. Reduced deaths\n\nBirmingham's Director of Public Health Dr Justin Varney says air pollution costs the city about 1,000 lives a year, primarily by causing cancer, lung disease and heart disease.\n\nHe said the effects of poor air quality gave the city a bad start in battling Covid, which is more severe in those with existing respiratory conditions.\n\nIn 2011, it was estimated that 906 deaths in the West Midlands were attributable to nitrogen dioxide pollution, including 371 in Birmingham. The number is expected to decrease substantially as a result of predicted emissions reductions, the city council said.\n\nPublic Health England produced a report explaining that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of early death - contributing to the equivalent of 5 per cent of all deaths globally. Long-term exposure to particulate air pollution is estimated to have an effect equivalent to 29,000 deaths a year in the UK.\n\n3. A more pleasant environment\n\nSitting out at a pub, cafe or restaurant is unpleasant if you have pollution from cars, lorries and buses blowing all over you, your clothes and your food and drink. How much soot would you like with that salad?\n\nCouncils have in the past ruled that in some cases, applications for pavement cafes (with outdoor tables and chairs) would not be approved if in an area of poor air quality.\n\nWe've all seen exhausts belching out fumes at city centre bus stops and bus depots. The pollution can also be more obvious when we are crossing the road between cars in traffic jams.\n\nReducing traffic emissions can make a more pleasant environment for walking and sitting, even just on the commuter dash to and from the office. No one wants to see haze or even smog as pollution gets out of control and envelops a city.\n\n4. Big boost for the economy\n\nIf air pollution can be reduced, then the NHS won't have to spend as much on treating all the people it has affected.\n\nIn addition, the productivity of businesses is reduced when people are off sick or in hospital because of air pollution - or taking time off work to deal with illness or death among family members affected by pollution.\n\nDefra - the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - has estimated that poor air quality costs a total of £2.7 billion due to its impact on worker productivity. That was in 2014 so the cost could be even higher now.\n\nCentre for Cities points out that in London, the Ultra Low Emission Zone generated around £40 million in charges between its launch in April 2019 and October that same year. The money has been reinvested by Transport for London in improving and upgrading the city's buses and taxis.\n\n5. Start of a cleaner, greener future\n\nGovernment officials believe initiatives such as Clean Air Zones can be a foundation for a city's future because they become a deciding factor on other matters - such as planning, the environment, waste disposal, public transport and roads.\n\nBasically, Birmingham's Clean Air Zone could become the start of a new age in the city.\n\nThe Government says: \'A Clean Air Zone supports local plans for growth. The zone will become part of, and fit with, local strategies, plans and policies and transport plans.\'\n\nBirmingham City Council said its measures to tackle pollution are \'designed to unlock economic growth opportunities and support wider initiatives to improve social well-being and lives of residents. A larger, more economically active population will have diverse transport needs and shifting attitudes to travel and travel behaviour.\n\n\'The implementation of a CAZ will capitalise on those shifts, as well as play a part in the need to transform Birmingham into a sustainable, low-emission city region. A CAZ would also contribute towards Birmingham's committed 60 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2027 as road vehicle transport currently accounts for 20 per cent of carbon emissions in Birmingham.\'\n\n6. Improved public transport\n\nBirmingham City Council says it has already completed a scheme to increase the number of park and ride schemes and has been improving the city's buses.\n\nNational Express is working to make all of its buses CAZ-compliant with a large number already on the roads.\n\nThe council is also bringing in new hydrogen-powered buses. The 20 new buses, which are made by Wrightbus and are the world's first zero-emission hydrogen fuel-cell double deckers, are being introduced with National Express West Midlands from April 2021.\n\nTaxis are also getting a revamp. The emissions of 65 of Birmingham's Hackney carriages (black cabs) have been reduced by fitting LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) fuelled engines. These engines are Euro 6 compliant, meaning they would not be charged to enter the Clean Air Zone.\n\nAdditional funding has been awarded by the Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) to introduce 197 electric taxi charging points, all of which will offer fast or rapid charging facilities for Hackney carriages and private hire vehicles. Electric vehicles don't have to pay for going into the Clean Air Zone.\n\n7. A city for cyclists\n\nThe city council is working to make the city super-friendly to cyclists.\n\nUnder its Birmingham Cycle Revolution, it aims to \'make cycling an everyday way to travel in Birmingham over the next 20 years.\'\n\nThe scheme has set a target of five per cent of all trips in the city to be made by bicycle by 2023 and to double this again to 10 per cent by 2033. In 2017/18, two new, high-quality cycle routes were constructed, linking the city centre to Selly Oak and Perry Barr.\n\nThe council said: \'Birmingham is creating Green Travel Districts with less congestion, less pollution, fewer accidents, and healthier, safer, more productive communities.\n\n\'In densely populated residential areas, the aim is to create an environment where residents, workers and visitors can safely walk, cycle or take public transport as their preferred travelling option.\'\n\n8. No more congestion\n\nEfforts to reduce pollution through a Clean Air Zone involve changes to traffic flows. That brings an end to congestion and also means shorter journey times, fewer road accidents, and a better experience for those who turn to cycling or walking.\n\nCouncils putting in place Clean Air Zones are encouraged to carry out changes to road layouts and junctions that can divert cars away from city centres. Signs highlighting alternative routes can be installed, and traffic lights modified to change more often and prevent queues of vehicles building up and emitting fumes.\n\nRoad humps may be removed too, the Government advice states.\n\nCouncils introducing Clean Air Zones are also encouraged to crack down on \'unnecessary engine idling\' at bus depots, bus stops and HGV freight hubs.\n\n9. Everyone working together\n\nClean Air Zones can be a chance for councils to work more closely with other organisations on improving air quality and making cities greener, the Government says.\n\nAt a local level, this includes collaborating with bus companies, taxi and private hire firms, freight and delivery companies, retailers, schools, community groups, charities, and health groups.\n\nAt a national level, it could mean working with Highways England, the Environment Agency, Public Health England, and neighbouring local authorities.\n\nCouncils are also asked to work with local businesses to increase awareness among staff about public transport choices and alternatives. Businesses should be encouraged to upgrade fleets and to insist any taxis or private hire cars they regularly use are low-emission vehicles.\n\nThe Government said: \'Local authorities should also consider the role of incentive schemes to provide an opportunity to reward business. These may range from local award schemes to recognise CAZ-friendly businesses, through to preferential business rates if they can demonstrate strong commitment and action in support of the ambitions of a Clean Air Zone.\'\n\nPollution caused by the school run could be tackled by 'walk to school' initiatives, and colleges and universities encouraged to provide more cycle racks.\n\nOther potential action includes:\n\ncycling and walking routes linking public transport bases such as train stations to employment hubs and education centres, signs giving walking and cycling distances or journey times to encourage take-up route-planning apps and maps to highlight alternatives cycle hire schemes and the provision of cycling training advice, such as through Bikeability\n\nLibby Harris from Birmingham Friends of the Earth said: \'The introduction of the Clean Air Zone is a necessary step in the fight to tackle the harmful and illegal levels of NO2 and particulate matter in the air in our city.\n\n\'Air pollution contributes up to 1,000 premature deaths each year in Birmingham. Motor traffic is a key contributor to this.\n\n\'We do recognise that certain groups may be more adversely impacted than others by the financial cost of adapting to the CAZ but (as environmentalists) we also recognise that a clean air, low car strategy will bring long-term health benefits to all of us. We would urge the council to do more to help disadvantaged groups to access more financial support.\n\nThe Government set out its vision as follows: \'Clean Air Zones improve the urban environment to support public health and the local economy, making cities more attractive places to live, work, do business and spend leisure time.\n\n\'They support cities to grow and transition to a low-emission economy thus ensuring these benefits are sustainable for the long term.\'\n\nIn making our vehicles into lean green machines, the Government has set a clear long-term ambition for all new cars and vans to be zero-emission by 2040, and for nearly every car and van on Britain's roads to be zero-emission by 2050.\n\nTell us what you think in the comments below" />
